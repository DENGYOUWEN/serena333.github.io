# 好奇心

不是这样，不是那样

人要学会和自己相处

和各种念头各种语言各种身份各种情绪

你了解的知识不是为折磨自己而存在

我们受苦，是为了穿越痛苦

如果别人都想帮助你调动内在动机

为何你还要一次次杀死自己

求得你心里的他人的饶恕？


好奇心，本质也是一种内在动机。

你认为如何会更好？
你觉得事情是什么样的？

不要把自己逼到角落

不要去假装你有能力、你有趣、你有见解、你与众不同、你不可或缺、你符合一个新青年的标准

低到尘埃里

再开出你的花

低到尘埃

再找到你的支撑


为什么会害怕他们？
为什么会紧张？

因为担心他们觉得我不够好


你为什么来这家公司
你为什么想要做这份工作？


cause it is the place with most wise I've since, I think I can learn more here. And they teach people, that's precious. The wise people know deserve spread to more. 

What kind of wise?

To learn, to create, to improve, to explore, 
To break rules, 
To know yourself, open your heart, there isn't only inane you thought, there are many precise pieces of crystal which stun people. But it's you who decide which one to peak, how to accumulate, and how to carve.

Open your heart, connect with the world.

You are still afraid? Don't know your internal motivation?

No one trust the stranger at first. Recall how you and Henry start to know each other? You talk, and you talk more. 

Let's talk about internal motivation. You need relatedness, autonomy, and competence
